    "My pipeline consists of 7 steps. First I import the image and convert it to grayscale. Then I apply a gaussian smoothing filter. Then detect edges using a canny edge detector. I then create a mask for the area of interest where the highway lines are likely to reside. I perform a hough transform to detect the lines within the masked area and then output (draw) the lines on the original image. \n",
